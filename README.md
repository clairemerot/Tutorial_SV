# Tutorial_SV
This is half-a-day training about SV detection using diverse sets of data. 

## 01 - Using SNPs & local PCA to detect haploblocks putatively representing large rearrangements

## 02 - Comparing assemblies for large rearrangements

## 03 - Assessing breakpoints and detecting other SVs with long-reads

## 04 - Using population dataset of short-reads to detect SVs

## 05 - Towards graph-based analysis
